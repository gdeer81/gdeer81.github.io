## About Me and this blog

Hi I'm Gary you may know me from Clojure Slack channel as gdeer81 or from github as gdeer81 or twitter as @_GaryD

I also run the San Antonio Clojure Meetup.

I've documented my trials and tribulations with technology on various platforms with different limitations like 120 characters or your content is owned by someone else

This platform is more freestyle but I will still put constraints on myself because creativity flourishes inside of constraints.

* Constraint 1: I'll be focusing on the Clojure ecosystem and community
* Constraint 2: Terseness: Content will be more than a tweet but way less than an essay
* Constraint 3: Light footprint. Words and code examples will dominate and images will only be used as a last resort to demonstate a point. No fancy, heavy javascript either.
* Constraint 4: No happy path posts. After toiling in agony and then finally figuring out what the issue was I will document all my false assumptions missteps and failures alongside all of the successes that I've had


I want this to be a pleasant place for Clojure enthusiasts to enjoy a light read about one of their favorite languages and a place for Clojure beginners to go to see they're not alone when they make mistakes. I also want this to be easy to sprint read and read on your phone.
