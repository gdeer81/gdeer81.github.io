# A Little History
          So that we may not repeat it

Originally tried to maintain a developer blog like some of my favorite "thought leaders"

However, I underestimated the work it takes to keep this thing going

## another attempt
         maybe try something a bit different, yeah?

I thought maybe I was fiddling with the site generator and trying to find a good design for my site was eating up too much time

So I thought I'd try documenting one of my dev learning journeys on twitter.
It was a simple plan. I'd come home, work on a project, at the end of the day tweet about what I did and learned.
That lasted maybe a week. The project and the posting.

### and then the site goes dead

                    That was around 2015

## Now we pick up where we left off
                    This time will be different, yeah?

Now it's 2020 and the world is a mess and we're all stuck inside so
but working from home is great and as it turns out, not being stuck in an office all day does wonders for my motivation

The time that I would've been driving home from work I now spend writing to you, dear reader.

But time and motivation are just two legs of the stool...

The missing piece was an interesting topic. Enter my third attempt at game development in Clojure

What you're witnessing now is the result of me finally finding another project that I'm excited about
I've been so excited about it that I've been posting in the Gitter chat all the things I could've been posting here

Since the technology stack I'm using is alpha level I will try to keep on top of updating any posts that have code or statements that are out of date. There's nothing worse than not being correct on the internet.

See you in [the Archives...](/archives)
