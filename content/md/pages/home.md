{:title "Game Dev in Clojure?!"
 :layout :page

 This is my third attempt at making games in Unity with Clojure and it's going well

## Tools

* Unity 3d
* Gnu Image Manipulation Tool (Until I breakdown and get a subscription to photoshop)
* Intellij with Cursive (no, I'm not using <insert your favorite editor here>, want to fight about it?)

## Libraries

* [Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia) Literally the only way to use Clojure with Unity and what 80% of my posts will be about
* [Hard](https://github.com/selfsame/hard) It has some convenience functions and hides some messy interop code with nice pretty Clojure code
* [Tween](https://github.com/selfsame/tween) An amazing tweening library and is my go-to for easily writing wacky - waving - inflatable - arm - flailing - tube - man code
* [Pastoral](https://github.com/flybot-sg/Pastoral) using re-frame in Arcadia? sign me up! There aren't any docs on how to use it? yikes, okay I'll figure it out.

I'll be updating my [Portfolio](/portfolio) page whenever I feel a project or game is worth sharing or is a major milestone for me (like my first board game etc.)

For the time being I'll mostly be posting code snippets and random thought experiments

Thanks for reading and

We'll see you in [the Archives...](/archives)
