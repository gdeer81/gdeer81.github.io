The word "Author" is doing a lot of work in this title..."Hopefully-Coherent-Post Writer" is more like it

## Meet the HCPW: Gary

He's a sweet boy who is just trying his best.

Why is he so obsessed with Clojure?
WHY does he love Datomic and Datalog and programming with data?

Hopefully the Archives answers most of these questions

Something I might not post about but probably should is my obsession with making coffee
Also if I don't post about this, which I probably should, I can also do good drawrings (sic)

Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

See you in [the Archives...](/archives)
